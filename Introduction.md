<h1>Introduction to Linux Operating System (OS):What is Linux?</h1>

# What is Linux? 

> **Linux** is an operating system or a kernel distributed under an open-source license. The kernel is a program at the heart of the Linux operating system that takes care of fundamental stuff, like letting hardware communicate with software.

# Who created Linux?
> Let's get know abit of this genuis guy. He is **Linus  Torvalds**, when he was computer science student he used to work on the **UNIX OS** and thought that it needed improvements.  However, his suggestions were rejected by designer of Unix. He thought of launching an OS which will be **receptive to changes, modifications suggested by its users.**  

# Linux get its attention 
> As we know in the early day Linux OS were not so user-friendly, as common use by the programmer. Also, Linus Torvalds never commercialize his product.  As the time go by the linux getting more user friendly with the help of programmer and user. 
>> The main purpose of Linux was the programmers is able to use the Linux Kernel to design their own custom operating system. With that Linux is the one of the most popular abd widely used kernel, and it is the backbone of popular operating systems like Ubuntu, Debian, and so on. 

# The benefits of using Linux 

* free operating system.
* open source, anyone with programming knowledge can modify it.
* it easy to learn Linux 
* Linux operating systems now offer millions of programs/applications and Linux softwares to choose from, most of them are free.
* Linux no need antivirus! Linux is a highly secure system. More so, there is global development community constantly looking at ways to enchance its security. With each upgrad, the OS becomes more secure and robust.
* **Linux freeware** is the OS of choice for Server environments due to its stability and reliability. A Linux based server could run non-stop without a reboot for years on end.

# Is it for me?

In yes if you are study Computer Science, IT, Computing and even you just a normal user. 

# People tell me to Learn about UNIX, but why Linux?
> Yes, UNIX is called mother of OS which laid out the foundation of Linux. Unix is designed for mainframes and is in enterprises and universities. While Linux now are fast becoming a household name for computer users, developers, and server environment. You may have to pay for Unix kernel while Linux it is free. 
>> The command on the both OS are usually the same. There is not much difference between UNIX and Linux. Though they might seem different, at the core, they are the same. Linux is Clone of UNIX, mean while learning one is same as learning another.
